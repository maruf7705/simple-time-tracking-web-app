## About The Project

TimeCraft is a minimalist web application for tracking your day in blocks of time. It's built for developers, designers, and professionals who appreciate clean interfaces, keyboard accessibility, and a distraction-free environment. The interface is designed with a refined dark mode, a monospaced font, and a subtle dot-grid background to help you focus on what matters: your time.

All data is stored locally in your browser, ensuring your information remains private and accessible without needing an account.

### Key Features

- **Daily Time Blocking**: Visualize your day with a clean, chronological list of time entries.
